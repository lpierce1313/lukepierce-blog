# First Blog

This is my first blog, and I am actually very excited to start sharing the knowledge that I do have on here. Most of the these blogs will be about generating wealth, fitness, self improvement or even software development. Thank you for coming to the blogs.

### Investing Introduction

There is a fearful connotation tied to investing as it could be risky or you would possibly lose all your money, but that is simply not true. You would only lose money if you did not know what you were doing.
For example, putting all of your money into a cryptocurrency or a company that is destined to fail is great opportunity to lose everything.

Investing can be a great way to generate wealth and it is generally much safer than keeping it in a savings account as inflation is always increasing every year.

### The issue with a savings account

According to the graph below, it roughly means the U.S.-dollar money supply consisting of physical currency and what's in bank accounts.

As you can see from the graph, the dollar is becoming `increasingly` less valuable each year.

The best possible way to combat the dollar becoming less valuable is to protect the money that you do have `Savings/Cash/Checkings` against inflation by having quality investments.

One example of a `safe` and `quality` investment is the S&P 500. Below is a graph of the stock share price year over year from 2009 to 2019. Yes, it has some dips here and there,
but it continually goes up and actually follows inflation of the US Dollar.

If you had a large percentage of your money in the S&P 500 instead of savings account, you would have far more money and your money would be protected against the constant
inflation of the US Dollar. So, what are you waiting for?

Other, great and safe investments are included below with how you could invest.

- S&P 500 (Could use Public.com app) 10% increase each year
- Mutual Funds or ETFs _Exchange-Traded Fund_ (WealthFront.com) 10-11% percent each year
- Divided Stocks, little safer than regular stocks (Could also use Public.com app) _Depends on stock company, do your research with this_

### Societal Norms

I find it interesting that the average millenial has no issue spending endless money on food, drinks, and clothes, doesn't budget their own money,
and also doesn't think twice about student or car loans. Car Loans are the worst as cars are depreciating assets. Stocks are appreaciating assets.
I believe this is caused by not being educated properly in finances and following what the majority of Americans do.

Try buying that car in cash, it might be a beater though... This way you can use more of your monthly income to buy into the stock market on safe investments that will earn you money over time
instead of depreciating over time, like a car, the investments will continually appreaciate and will be protected inflation.

After all of that, if you are still intimidated, try easing your way into the stock market. Instead of investing 85% of your money, put a very small percent and watch it grow. That way
you will be more comfortable investing and even become a pro with more experience.

Thanks for reading my first blog!
